[00:35.80]Sunday's Coming I Wanna Drive My Car
[00:39.10]To Your Apartment With Present Like A Star
[00:43.00]Forecaster Said The Weather May Be Rainy Hard
[00:47.00]But I Know The Sun Will Shine For Us
[00:50.60]
[00:51.40]Oh Lazy Seagull Fly Me From The Dark
[00:55.00]I Dress My Jeans And Feed My Monkey Banana
[00:59.00]Then I Think My Age How Old Skyline How Far
[01:03.50]Or We Need Each Other In California
[01:06.60]
[01:07.60]You Show Me Your Body Before Night Comes Down
[01:11.50]I Touch Your Face And Promise To Stay Ever Young
[01:15.50]On This Ivory Beach We Kissed So Long
[01:19.50]It Seems That The Passion's Never Gone
[01:22.50]
[01:23.50]You Sing Me Your Melody And I Feel So Please
[01:27.50]I Want You To Want Me To Keep Your Dream
[01:31.50]Together We'll Run Wild By A Summer Symphony
[01:35.60]This Is What We Enjoyed Not A Fantasy
[01:41.10]
[01:55.60]The Tin-man's Surfing I Wanna Try My Luck
[01:59.00]To The Top Of Tide Rip Like Just Have Some Drugs

[02:23.60]Would You Believe My Honey It's Califonia
[02:26.50]
